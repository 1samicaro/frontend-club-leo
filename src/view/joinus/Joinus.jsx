              <p>
              For this reason, <b>LEO</b> needs to grow around the world, and to achieve this, it has created the <b>Friends Plan</b>, a Referral Program that calls on its partners to support this growth. . , doing a very simple job: <b>Invite friends to join as partners, with a maximum of 20 guests.</b></p>
              <p>
              With this simple work, each partner will be able to organize their own <b>RPA Personal Network of Friends</b>, and <b>LEO</b> will provide them with an income (cashback) that can be very important and permanent.

              <p>
              • Member participation is free and voluntary. A member can not participate, and continue enjoying the programs to promote reading, writing and multilingualism.
              </p>

              • Friends can reside in any country in the world.
              </p>
              <p>
              • For each guest that joins as a member, and those that they in turn invite, <b>LEO</b> recognizes a % of the membership fee (up to 60%).
              </p>
              <p>
              • The Personal Network of Friends that you organize is the property of the member for life, with his or her income and benefits.

          <p>
          • By joining by filling out the form online, each member creates their username and password; The program automatically creates “My Account” so you can track your guests and income in real time. </p>
          <p>
          • The partner invites other people to join <b>LEO</b>, and when filling out the form, they register the username of the promoting partner; The system links them into your personal network of RPA friends, for life. </p>
          <p>
          • The system automatically distributes 60% of the value of the membership fee ($30,000) between the new member's RPA. This income accumulates in real time in your Personal Account, and at the end of the month it is transferred to your financial account. During the month, with his or her income, the member was able to purchase the books, goods and services offered by LEO allies. </p>

          <p>
          Of the $50,000 membership fee, <b>LEO</b> allocates 60% ($30,000) to remunerate the invitation work carried out by its members, an income that will grow successively with the new guests, generating a very important annual income. as detailed in the following table: </p>

                 This will be the result of my work: Once I organize my b <b>RPA</b>, I will be able to have an annual income of $1.5 billion, which will be for life, because <b>LEO</b> recognizes both the income as annual renewals.
